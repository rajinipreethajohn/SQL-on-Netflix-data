# SQL-on-Netflix-data

This project is a demonstration of SQL Syntax using the Netflix Movies and TV shows Dataset. We showcase example query on key SQL topics such as SQL Keywords,Data filtering, Joins, Unions, Aggregate functions, temp tables,Window functions etc. This Notebook will serve as an excellent one stopper for reference while writing related SQL projects.

I have however started started the project EDA with python to get key insights into our dataset. This served me well, as I was able to get a good understanding of my data and the features. The pandas-profiling report has presented me further details regarding each of my features. The overview as usual, helps me in understanding the shape of my dataset, duplicates if any and null values too. 

With that background work, I tried to then query my queries using SQL.
